## Hi, I'm A Workshop About R.

"R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics." - [R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) 

R is commonly used in many scientific disciplines for statistical analysis. The goal of this workshop is to introduce non-programmers to R and best practices for using R to develop data analyses. 

## Skills Agenda

- Set up some core tools:
    - <https://www.r-project.org>
    - <https://www.rstudio.com>
- Anatomy of an analytics project in R
    - Create a project
    - Import some data
    - Explore descriptive statistcs
    - Plot exploratory data visualizations
    - Save and share results
    
    ...rinse, repeat...

## Topics Covered

- The data analysis lifecycle
- "Tidy" data
- Know your file system
- Introduction to datatypes
- Objects & functions
- A Grammar of graphics

## Topics Not Covered

*This workshop focuses on teaching the fundamentals of R and does not teach statistical analysis.*

*Anything other than "rectangular" data structures*

*Python, SQL, Excel, SAS, SPSS, Stata (although we will talk about them)*

## Why Program at All?

Programming supports data analyses that are:

- Deliberate
    - Your analyses follows a process that is visible after the fact
- Reproducible
    - Your analysis can be recreated by others (or yourself) at a later date
- Transferable
    - Your analysis can be shared with others
- Scalable
    - Analyses can be used on data that are increasingly complex and/or large
    
## Because We're Lazy & Forgetful

### Don't Repeat Yourself (or others, for that matter)

### Write data for machines;

### Write code for humans

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# This is a code comment
# It is used to explain something or put information that the 
# computer should ignore
```

## Why Program in R?

- R is widely adopted and has a supportive community
- R is extensible with over 15,000 packages
- R is free as in beer *and* free as in speech

## R Plays Well With Others

- haven for importing and exporting data from SAS, SPSS and Stata
- readxl for working with Microsoft Excel files
- DBI for interacting with databases
- httr for working with data on the web

## R for Data Science (R4DS)

## "Nouns" & "Verbs"

A grammar of data analysis includes "nouns" and "verbs": objects and functions

### Objects *are* Things

- vectors
- atomic values
- dataframes
- libraries
- lists
- files
- functions

## "Nouns" & "Verbs"

A grammar of data analysis includes "nouns" and "verbs": objects and functions

### Functions *act on* Objects and Return Results

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
- filter()
- mean()
- gather()
- lm()
- plot()
- str()
```

## "Nouns" & "Verbs"

A grammar of data analysis includes "nouns" and "verbs": objects and functions

### Functions *act on* Objects and Return Results

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# Creates a vector using c(), note coercion of variables
foo <- c(1, 2, TRUE, 3.5, 33, 2.1)
str(foo)
```
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# Creates a vector using c(), note coercion of variables
foo <- c(1, 2, "TRUE", 3.5, 33, 2.1)
str(foo)
```
## Nouns & Verbs

A grammar of data analysis includes nouns and verbs, objects and actions

### Functions *act on* Objects and Return Results
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
# Creates a list, which can hold multiple data types
bar <- list(1, 2, TRUE, "Jamie")
str(bar)
```
